Custom Commands:

CONNECTSERVER - <IP><PORT>
Tells the server to try and connect to the IP address and port given. Good way to 'Hotwire' a start.

MESSAGEBUFFER
Gives list of how many messages the server has in the client buffer for messages.

DOCSERVERS
Gives list of all documented servers.


Two error codes:

-1 == unknown command, / wrong variables etc
-2 == We fucked up, usually a system command.
